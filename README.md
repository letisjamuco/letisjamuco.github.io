About Me
--------

As an undergraduate student at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunication of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, I find the intersection of technology and innovation highly intriguing. I possess a natural inclination towards organization and enjoy structuring information and processes with the aim of increasing efficiency and achieving desired outcomes.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am driven by a desire to continuously learn new technologies, particularly in the exciting realms of AI and machine learning. I believe that staying abreast of these advancements is essential in today's rapidly evolving tech landscape.

Professionally, I am a Junior SAP SD (Sales and Distribution) Consultant working diligently in the dynamic field of enterprise resource planning. Beyond my professional endeavors, I am also a web development enthusiast, fueled by the desire to create innovative and user-centric digital experiences.
